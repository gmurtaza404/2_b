CLIENT SIDE CODE
1. Implement job status code. 
2. Add some check on submitted files? Allow bash scripts as well.
3. Add code to get data of currently connected zombies
4. Prettify the code :P



MAIN CODE
1. Make a datastructure to track jobs and their status on different machines. (Use some DB perhaps?)
2. Finalize the code of endpoints and make them more generic. 
3. Add logic to assign names to the zombies. 
4. Evaluate performance under load.
5. Implement a trivial scheduler that satisfies two conditions:
    a) Can accept any number of Jobs and will ensure that all the jobs will get executed in finite time.
    b) Will make sure that only one job is executed on a zombie node at a time. 
    c) Maximizes the utilization of the zombie nodes.


ZOMBIE CODE
1. Read all the configurations from a config file rather.
2. Add capability to execute bash scripts.
3. Add capability to run jobs with sudo access.
4. Clean code up, and code to log all the events and upload the log file to the Main after say 1 Hour.
5. Evaluate connection's correctness and soundness in presence of proxies.
6. Add the logic that allows the zombie to send all the script's traffic through a proxy.
